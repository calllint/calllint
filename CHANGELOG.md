# Changelog

All notable changes to CallLint are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project aims
to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) from 1.0.0
onward. While pre-1.0, minor versions may include breaking changes.

`MCPGuard` was the internal codename for this project; the public product is
**CallLint** (see [ADR 0008](docs/adr/0008-brand-transition-calllint.md)).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Project license changed from MIT to **Apache-2.0**; added `NOTICE` and
  `TRADEMARKS.md`. The npm tarball ships `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`.

### Changed (prior)
- **Brand transition: MCPGuard → CallLint (v0.3-R0).** The public product is now
  CallLint. This renamed, with no change to scanner semantics:
  - npm package `mcpguard` → `calllint` (unscoped, single bundled CLI)
  - internal workspace scope `@mcpguard/*` → `@calllint/*`
  - CLI binary `mcpguard` → `calllint`
  - cache/baseline directory `.mcpguard/` → `.calllint/`
  - on-disk schema identifiers `mcpguard.{report,baseline,drift,policy}.v0` →
    `calllint.*.v0`
  - policy file `mcpguard.policy.json` → `calllint.policy.json`
  - config input key `x-mcpguard` → `x-calllint`
  - SARIF tool driver name `MCPGuard` → `CallLint`; report titles updated
  - No migration shim: no public release wrote the old paths, so the rename is a
    clean cut.
- README expanded to the full public section set (what it is / checks / does not
  check / install / quick start / example report / rule list / security model /
  limitations / roadmap).

### Added
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).

## [0.3-R1] — Distribution readiness

### Added
- Single bundled-CLI distribution: publishable package with an empty runtime
  dependency list, `files: ["dist"]` allowlist, `prepack` rebuild, and npm
  metadata ([ADR 0007](docs/adr/0007-cli-distribution-strategy.md)).
- `scripts/package-smoke.mjs` + `pnpm pack:smoke`: packs the real tarball and
  asserts the manifest, bin/type/shebang, an empty runtime dep list, and a
  self-contained bundle; then installs into an isolated global prefix and runs
  the installed binary.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: typecheck/test/build/smoke/pack:smoke with a
  least-privilege token; never publishes, never executes a scanned server.
- Apache-2.0 `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` (ship in the tarball) and `SECURITY.md`.

### Changed
- `apps/cli` made publishable: dropped `private`, moved `workspace:*` to
  `devDependencies`, bin canonicalized to `dist/index.js`.

## [0.2.1] — Hardening

### Added
- MONEY golden coverage driven end-to-end from a single source of truth.
- `block-observed-payment` golden: observed money-mover + capability → BLOCK.
- Online no-downgrade invariant: findings carry `source`/`fetchedAt`; enrichment
  is advisory and code-enforced never to lower a verdict
  ([ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-online-enrichment-advisory.md)).
- Windows path/shell regression coverage.
- `LIMITATIONS.md` (trust boundaries) and `docs/release-checklist.md`.

### Changed
- Split name-inferred financial risk (`action.financial`, INFERRED → REVIEW)
  from observed money movement (`action.financial-observed`, OBSERVED → BLOCK).

## [0.2.0] — Engine completion

### Added
- Drift detection (`baseline` / `verify`) with rug-pull signal on
  pinned-version changes.
- SARIF 2.1.0 output (GitHub Code Scanning) and a self-contained HTML report.
- `npm:` and `github:` scan targets; opt-in `--online` advisory enrichment.

## [0.1.0] — Foundation

### Added
- pnpm monorepo: config parser, resolver, static analyzer (eight detectors),
  deterministic risk engine (S0–S5 classes, SAFE/REVIEW/BLOCK/UNKNOWN verdicts),
  policy-as-code with a CI gate, stable drift fingerprints, scan pipeline, and a
  terminal/compact/JSON report renderer.
- Golden verdict contract enforced through the built binary.
- CLI: `scan` / `baseline` / `verify` / `explain` / `policy` with documented
  exit codes (0 SAFE · 10 REVIEW · 20 UNKNOWN · 30 BLOCK · 40 DRIFT · 2 usage ·
  3 error).
